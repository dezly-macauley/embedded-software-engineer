What is an "lvalue" (pronounced ell-value)?

An lvalue is a more general concept that refers to any expression
that represents a memory location, which could include variables,
array elements, dereferenced pointers,
or even specific fields within a structure.

In C programming, lvalues include:

- Variables
- Array elements (array[index])
- Dereferenced pointers (*ptr)
- Specific fields within a structure (struct_variable.field)
